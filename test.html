<h2 style="background-color: sienna"> My First Week</h2>
<p style="color: red"> Tuesday was the official starting day of the MIT Program.
    My expectations after the four and a half months that I'll be here are: to learn how to code
    and be able to create an app (which p.s will be so cool).
    So far, we've installed the tools needed for developing websites
    and we are currently being taken through the meaning of tags in the directories that we have created as we are coding.

<p style="color: black"> I cannot wait for week two when the real intense training will begin.
    I'm sure it'll be kinda tough but I'm ready to toil so that I can be the best.
